## Features
- Custom animated CSS loader with four span elements
- Dynamic hover effects on the loader and button
- External button link styled with CSS

## Code Explanation
1. **HTML Structure**:  
   The loader is made using four `span` elements inside a `div` container, which are animated using `@keyframes`.
   
   ```html
   <div class="loader">
       <span></span>
       <span></span>
       <span></span>
       <span></span>
   </div>
   ```

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - The loader has a square container with dimensions `200px x 200px` and uses the `:hover` pseudo-class for interactive glow effects.
   - Each span element has a linear gradient animation moving along its assigned path.

3. **Button and Link**:
   - Thereâ€™s a styled button linking to a [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@CodebySkmaurya555?si=ia6vN-4EYhTZ_1CK).
   - The button and link change colors on hover for better UX.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the animation in action.
